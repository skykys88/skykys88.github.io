<p>The following paragraphs are very long schizophrenic ramblings about the troubled set of electronics that had found it ways to become my so-called "principal instrument" when working as an electronics performer. Enjoy.</p>

<p>Unlike other composers of my age, I consider myself to be a late starter in contemporary music, especially in the field of electronic music. My first lesson in contemporary music started around 5 months before I started formal training in music at the College of Music, Mahidol University. From the first class of electronic music where I had my first encounter with my mentor's Eurorack system, that was when I knew I had to get into this stuff.</p>

<p>I saved up for my first set of modules and case and finally pulled the trigger around early September 2023. The first set of modules was purely for gestural performance and learning microcontroller programming basics. It consisted of: Make Noise Pressure Points, 2hp Play, ElectroSmith Patch.init(), Mutable Instruments Beads, and 4ms Listen I/O. That setup worked just fine for my needs but I later felt the need to switch things out. In the same time period, my Eurorack soon encountered its first "dust collector" phase.</p>

<p>November 2023, better known as the start of college apps season, came. By that time, I had became semi-acquainted with electronic sound composition and already started playing some shows with my Eurorack. But that was not enough (or at least in my opinion) to show college faculties that I had the makings of an Electronic Musician. I set my modular synthesizer aside for about 2 months until I had received the Supplemental Assignment from my TIMARA (Oberlin) BM application.</p>

<p>Those who know me quite well might have already seen that work and knew about the outcome of the application (if you really wanna know more or see the work my email is at the home page of this website). It is worth noting that the creation of the Supplemental Assignment led me back to working with my modular synthesizer again. During that time period was also my first (and only) Fata Morgana show with PHUPA as a modular synthesist duo which also led back to my short-lived reconciliation with my instrument, as we soon part ways into the second dust collection phase.</p>
