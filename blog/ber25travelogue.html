<h1>Berlin Travelogue November 2025: Berlin, Berghain, Research, Multichannel Audiovisual Livecoding, Christmas Markets, and a heap more of stuff</h1>

<h5>28112025 by SKYKYS (still jetlagged from QR082 and QR836)</h5>

<h3>Massive thanks to Goethe-Institut Thailand, IMSE at KMITL, Most Wanted: Music Hybrid Music Lab 2025 and TEAMS for making this trip happen. I'm super grateful for my mentor/brother figure Thanapat Ryan Ogaslert and my BASc research advisor Matthias Jung for helping me with laying the foundational basis for my practice-based research work.</h3>

<p>This Berlin trip was a <b>fucking</b> blast! It was a very special trip for me as the research paper that was being presented was deeply tied to dance music and club culture, and presenting this work in the clubbing capital just adds more to the excitement. It is also the last trip of 2025, the first year that I travel for work. Since accepting Sonic Officer's offer to travel in December 2024, I have been travelling every 3-6 months to somewhere new and meeting a lot of people. I also went to Berghain (<i>duh, of course you're gonna say that dude</i>) and Tresor and had loads of fun.</p>

<p>Before I start about Berlin, I want to briefly reflect on career growth. Shortly after I declined my admission to the TIMARA BM program (dean's scholarship) in April 2024, TIMARA Professor of Computer Music Tom Lopez gave me a blessing, telling me that he is "certain you [Me, the writer] will have opportunities to travel and study around the world", and it just so happens that I found myself in Hong Kong just 8 months after that. I have been rapidly working to elevate the quality of my works and performances with each passing event, and I am really proud of myself for that.</p>

<p>I went to the Synthesizer Museum Berlin in Kotti (<i>Kottbusser Tor</i>) and did some fun stuff. Here's the <a href="https://skykys.bandcamp.com/album/six-pitched-unpitched-variations-on-klai-baan">bandcamp link</a> to the album (six pitched/unpitched variations on <i>Klai Baan</i>). </p>

<i>Love and take care</i>
