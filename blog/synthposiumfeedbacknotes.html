<h1>SYNTHposium Talk Script: Two Feedback Studies: a study of aesthetics and feedback musicianship in the 21st century in the case of “dìaw / เดี่ยว” and “khûu / คู่”</h1>

<p>My research, “Two Feedback Studies”, touches on the subject of feedback musicianship and compositional aesthetics in the 21st century through a set of tools, in both the analog and digital audio domains. The research output is in the form of a sound study consisting of two electroacoustic compositions, “dìaw / เดี่ยว” and “khûu / คู่”.</p>

<p>Feedback, as a compositional tool, has been around since the dawn of the history of electronic music (tape era, elektronische Musik, musique concrete) and evolved throughout the years, following the trend of technological advancements. In its early years, composers like David Tudor (Toneburst, Pulsers, Rainforest), Éliane Radigue (Feedback Works) and Karlheinz Stockhausen (Kontakte) have extensively used electronic feedback in their works with equipment like laboratory equipment (impulse generators, spring reverberation tanks), audio equipment (generic mic-speaker feedback loop) and homebrew circuit boxes (Toneburst). The aesthetics of composing with analog technology has slowly faded away throughout the 70s and 80s, having its place taken by computer music technology. In the late 90s and early 2000s, surprisingly, a reemergence of interest in analog audio technology or the so-called “analog renaissance”, had popularized the No-Input Mixing Board along with other electronic music instruments like the Eurorack and Frac Rack format modular synthesizers.</p>

<p>The No-Input Mixing Board (NIMB) is an instrument that produces sound by patching the output of the mixer back into the system, creating a static feedback sound that can be further shaped through the use of equalizers, compressors, and other audio effects. The NIMB itself is often associated with the aesthetics of “junk”/“substandard” audio gear from the 90s trend of accessible audio gear, making music from supposed “junk”. The work(s) that laid the foundation for the NIMB to rise to its popularity as an instrument are the No-Input Mixing Board series by Toshimaru Nakamura, a Japanese sound artist and composer. Nakamura explored the sonic possibilities of the NIMB in various settings, including drone, ambient, noise, and microsound. Nakamura’s incorporation of effect pedals introduces movement to the static feedback tone through various effects like phaser, delay, looper, or even reverb.</p>

<p>In later years of the 2000s, leading up to the 2010s, sound artists working in the field of dance music also explored feedback techniques in their works. One of the most notable users of this technique is the British electronic music duo Emptyset, whose work fuses techno kick drums with low-end feedback oscillations generated through various means to create a low-end focused sound. Using feedback in this manner offers an alternative view to the use of audio feedback in another sonic context, differing from Nakamura’s.</p>

<p>My compositions as a result of this study investigate feedback in two settings: digital feedback and its modification through the use of computer music-oriented effects (granular synthesizer, resonator, physical modelling synthesizer) in dìaw / เดี่ยว, and the reconstruction and recontextualization of NIMB gestures through an electroacoustic composition in the elektronische Musik style in khûu / คู่.</p>

<p>In dìaw / เดี่ยว, I created a modular synthesizer patch that is essentially a “controlled feedback system” using my personal Eurorack system. The output from the end-of-chain module, Mutable Instruments Beads Texture Synthesizer, is fed back into itself, with a copy of itself sent into the Mutable Instruments Rings’ resonator input. Sonically, the result is a varying microsonic texture continuously modified by the twisting of knobs and changes in the structure of the resonator.</p>

<p>For khûu / คู่, I aimed to reconstruct the time-based sound world of recorded NIMB gestures in a new linear timeline, in the style of tape music (elektronische Musik), utilizing computer sound transformation. The sound source of the piece comprises recordings of NIMB improvisation totalling around 5 hours, with the NIMB patched in the style of a stereo “complex oscillator” voice. Gestures from the improvisation are extracted into miniature clips, ranging from 1 second to 1 minute, which are then edited and processed into a 9-minute electroacoustic piece. Fortunately, this piece was also commissioned by the Princess Galyani Vadhana International Symposium and the Birmingham ElectroAcoustic Sound Theatre (BEAST) for their joint performance featured as part of this year’s symposium.</p>
